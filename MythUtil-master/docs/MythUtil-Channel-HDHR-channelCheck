Requirements:  Only tested with MythTV 0.28, and recent
HDHR3-CC firmware.  It is unknown if it will work with previous
revisions.  To insure that the channel map in the HDHR3-CC
is correct you will need to run a "Detect Channels" from the
HDHR3-CC web page.  The device will run background scans
at future intervals to (attempt) to keep the maps accurate,
but large changes (such as the proposed MCLU rollout) may
require explicit re-scans.

For the examples below, it is presumed you are running on the
backend host with the default ports and the sourceid of your
cable lineup is 1.

Scenario:

You simply want a report on what channels are different
between your HDHR and MythTV
